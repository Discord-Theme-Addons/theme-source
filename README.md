# Theme Source
A simple source to change Discord's colors.

## What is Theme Source about?
The main purpsoe of Theme Source is to help new theme developers (or just users in general) to have an easier way changing all of Discord's colors, since using :root{**insert native variables here**} only themes Discord partially because Discord doesn't really use their variables everywhere that they should. Theme Source adds support for that.
- Remember, this is currently a work in progress. Some things may not be finished (most nticeable things should be done tho), or may not be done perfectly. Note that this will never be *exactly* perfect, but it will be done as close to perfect as it can be.
- Everything is coded in SCSS and sorted, but there will be a compiled CSS version for those who want to use it. You can find it in `./src/ThemeSorce-Compiled.css`.
- You have permission to use this, however I ask that you credit this repo for it. It's really up to you if you want to or don't want to. (crediting really isnt that hard but, oh well?)
- Theme Source is done entirely with Dark Theme in mind. If you're using this on light theme / plan making a light theme using this, please keep in mind that light theme will (most likely) have done things differently, so it may look off in some areas.

If you're looking for something that more than likely recolors Discord better than this, and is less confusing, I recommend using [Devilbro's Discord Recolor](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/DiscordRecolor), as it may be less confusing for those who are *really new* to this.

## Issues & Pull Requests
As I've stated above: since this is currently a WIP, there ***will be issues with it***. Some of these issues may already be known, or you may have found something that isn't. Before submitting an issue request, please make sure that there isnt' one submitted already pointing that specific issue out. If you know how to fix what's broken, you may make a pull request fixing said issue. Please remember to include the compiled version, otherwise it'll just be dismissed.
