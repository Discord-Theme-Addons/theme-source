# v1.0.0
Welp, third times a charm I guess? A lot has changed, so here's information on all of that.
- Version has been reset to v1.0.0. This may not make sense at first, but because of the unncessary version jumps, I feel like this is a good idea. It'll also help me (and you guys) better keep track of updates. Technically, this *would* be v3, but as I said, unnecessary version jumps are big bad bad.
- Source has been ENTIRELY redone ***again***, but this time it's a bit nicer compared to before. There's an actual file structure now, and it's done in SCSS. For those who still need the CSS version / prefer that, you can find the source for it in `src/css-compile/`.
- Repo has been redone entirely along with everything else to look nicer. **Variables for Noobs:tm** will be unavaible as it needs to be slightly redone. I don't know when I'll get to working on it, if ever. (someone is welcome to do it for me tho c:)
- Not really an update, but hopefully BetterDiscord & Web support will be coming in the near future when I get everything with the rework sorted out.

Please note (as this is a complete rewrite), I most likely missed themeing over a few things that I've themed in the past. If you notice anything that isn't themed, please make an issue request pointing it out. Note that it may take some time to push these updates, as I want to do small ones like that in bulk (unless something very noticeable breaks).
